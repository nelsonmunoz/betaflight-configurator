# Betaflight Configurator

![Betaflight](http://static.rcgroups.net/forums/attachments/6/1/0/3/7/6/a9088900-228-bf_logo.jpg)

Betaflight Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the Betaflight flight control system.

It runs as an app within Google Chrome and allows you to configure the Betaflight software running on any [supported Betaflight target](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/tree/master/src/main/target).

There is also now a standalone version available, since Google Chrome Apps are getting deprecated on platforms that aren't Chrome OS. [Downloads are available in Releases.](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases)

Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by Betaflight, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.

## Authors

Betaflight Configurator is a [fork](#credits) of the Cleanflight Configurator with support for Betaflight instead of Cleanflight.

This configurator is the only configurator with support for Betaflight specific features. It will likely require that you run the latest firmware on the flight controller.
If you are experiencing any problems please make sure you are running the [latest firmware version](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/releases/).

## Installation

## Native app build via NW.js

### Development

1. Install node.js
2. Change to project folder and run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.

### Running tests

`npm test`

### App build and release

The tasks are defined in `gulpfile.js` and can be run either via `gulp <task-name>` (if the command is in PATH or via `../node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js <task-name>`:

1. Optional, install gulp `npm install --global gulp-cli`.
2. Run `gulp <taskname> [[platform] [platform] ...]`.

List of possible values of `<task-name>`:
* **dist** copies all the JS and CSS files in the `./dist` folder.
* **apps** builds the apps in the `./apps` folder [1].
* **debug** builds debug version of the apps in the `./debug` folder [1].
* **release** zips up the apps into individual archives in the `./release` folder [1]. 

[1] Running this task on macOS or Linux requires Wine, since it's needed to set the icon for the Windows app (build for specific platform to avoid errors).

#### Build or release app for one specific platform
To build or release only for one specific platform you can append the plaform after the `task-name`.
If no platform is provided, all the platforms will be done in sequence.

* **MacOS** use `gulp <task-name> --osx64`
* **Linux** use `gulp <task-name> --linux64`
* **Windows** use `gulp <task-name> --win32`

You can also use multiple platforms e.g. `gulp <taskname> --osx64 --linux64`.

## Languages

Betaflight Configurator has been translated into several languages. The application will try to detect and use your system language if a translation into this language is available. You can help [translating the application into your language](https://crowdin.com/project/betaflight-configurator).

If you prefer to have the application in English or any other language, you can select your desired language in the options menu of the application.

## Notes

### WebGL

Make sure Settings -> System -> "User hardware acceleration when available" is checked to achieve the best performance
